Some notes of "Design Patterns in Java" by Dmitri Nesteruk in Udemy

## SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* A class should only have one reason to change.
* *Separation of concerns* - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.

<details>
<summary>How to fix it?</summary>

```java
// Hello World
```

</details>

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

```java
// Hello World
```

<details>
<summary>How to fix it?</summary>

```java

```

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.

<details>
<summary>How to fix it?</summary>

```java

```

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* Don't put too much into an interface; Split into separate interfaces.
* *YAGNI* - You Ain't Going to Need It.

```java

```

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to fix it?</summary>

```java
// Hello World
```

</details>

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction.
* Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
