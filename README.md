Some notes of "Design Patterns in Java" by Dmitri Nesteruk in Udemy

## SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A single class should have only one primary responsibility. A god object is anti-pattern.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The whole point of OCP is to be open for extension and closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
YAGNI = You Ain't Going to Need It

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstraction.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
