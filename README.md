Some notes of "Design Patterns in Java" by Dmitri Nesteruk in Udemy

## SOLID Design Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A single class should have only one primary responsibility. A god object is anti-pattern.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The whole point of OCP is to be open for extension and closed for modification.
